    historyTitle: "Who we are",
    historyText: "History\nThe company was founded in 2009, motivated primarily by two reasons: the knowledge inherited from the family, which was already active in foreign trade, and the desire to be an entrepreneur, a characteristic present in several generations. Since childhood, the founder was prepared by the family to follow this profession, learning about international business, ethics and world vision. Interestingly, when he was finally ready to work, the previous generation decided to end their activities, and it was then that the opportunity arose to continue the family legacy — with a modern and independent vision. There has always been in our essence the desire to explore the new, break through frontiers and follow paths with courage and autonomy.\n\nAt that time, the founder had already graduated in Foreign Trade from Mackenzie Presbyterian University, with academic experiences in the United States, Canada and, mainly, in the United Kingdom. In 2009, he decided to go to China, then recognized as the land of opportunities, breaking with the traditional business axis between Brazil, the United States and Europe. It was almost two months in China, on a journey driven by curiosity and determination, in search of a segment to work in.\n\nThe first step was in the kitchenware business, but Brazilian bureaucratic and legal barriers made the project unfeasible. Soon after, the opportunity arose to work with insulating materials for speakers, an area where he found a solid niche and great growth potential. Over time, the technical knowledge and connections built — both in China and in Brazil —, added to the network of contacts inherited from the family, made it possible to expand activities. The company started to offer foreign trade services to Brazilians and foreigners, while specializing in the commercialization of products for the speaker sector, consolidating itself in this market.\n\nToday, Global Key serves customers throughout Brazil and in several countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Argentina and China, working in the areas of import, export and international consulting. The founder is fluent in English and Spanish, and has deep knowledge about cultures, geographies and regional characteristics of various parts of the world — something that was born from a genuine interest in learning, and not just from professional obligation. The next objectives include perfecting mastery of the Chinese language, consolidating exports to China, expanding the product line focused on speaker repairs and expanding foreign trade services in the domestic market.",
